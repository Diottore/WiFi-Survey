# WiFi Survey - Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring and improvements made to the WiFi Survey repository.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Quality Improvements

#### Error Handling
- **Before**: Generic `except:` clauses throughout the codebase (9 instances)
- **After**: Specific exception handling with proper error types
  - `json.JSONDecodeError` for JSON parsing errors
  - `ValueError, TypeError` for type conversion errors
  - `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` for process timeouts
  - `OSError, ProcessLookupError` for process management errors

Example improvement:
```python
# Before
try:
    val = float(m.group(1))
except:
    pass

# After
try:
    val = float(m.group(1))
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    pass
```

#### Type Hints
Added comprehensive type hints to improve code maintainability:
- Function signatures with parameter and return types
- Import of typing module: `Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, List`
- Type annotations for variables where needed

Example:
```python
def run_cmd(cmd: str, timeout: int = 300, retries: int = 0) -> Tuple[str, str, int]:
    """Run command with optional retry logic"""
    ...
```

#### Code Style
- Reduced flake8 warnings from **181** to **84** (53% reduction)
- Fixed all critical syntax errors (E9, F63, F7, F82)
- Improved code formatting and consistency
- Added proper spacing between functions

### 2. Security Enhancements

#### SSH Security (iperf3_automation.py)
```python
ssh.connect(
    agent["host"],
    username=agent["user"],
    key_filename=agent["key"],
    timeout=10,
    look_for_keys=False,  # Security: only use specified key
    allow_agent=False      # Security: don't use SSH agent
)
```

#### Input Validation
All user inputs are now validated through centralized `Validator` class:
- Device names: max 100 characters
- Point IDs: max 50 characters
- Duration: 1-300 seconds
- Parallel streams: 1-16
- Repeats: 1-100

#### Encoding Safety
Added explicit UTF-8 encoding for file operations:
```python
out = stdout.read().decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
with open(OUTPUT_CSV, "w", newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
```

### 3. Shell Script Improvements

#### Fixed Shellcheck Warnings
- Added `-r` flag to all `read` commands to prevent backslash mangling
- Removed unused variable `tmp` from read statement

Before:
```bash
read -p "Press ENTER when ready..." tmp
```

After:
```bash
read -r -p "Press ENTER when ready..."
```

### 4. Documentation Additions

#### New Documentation Files

1. **SECURITY_GUIDE.md** (4.7 KB)
   - Network security best practices
   - Data security guidelines
   - Android/Termux security considerations
   - Input validation details
   - Secure deployment checklist

2. **TESTING.md** (6.5 KB)
   - Test structure and organization
   - Running tests guide
   - Adding new tests
   - CI/CD information
   - Manual testing procedures
   - Performance testing
   - Debugging guide

3. **requirements-dev.txt** (404 bytes)
   - Development dependencies
   - Linting tools (pylint, flake8, black)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Testing (pytest, pytest-cov)
   - Pre-commit hooks

#### Enhanced Docstrings
Added comprehensive docstrings to all major functions:
```python
def worker_run_point(
    task_id: str,
    device: str,
    point: str,
    run_index: int,
    duration: int,
    parallel: int
) -> None:
    """
    Execute a single point measurement in a background thread.

    Args:
        task_id: Unique identifier for this task
        device: Device name
        point: Point identifier
        run_index: Run number/index
        duration: Test duration in seconds
        parallel: Number of parallel iperf3 streams
    """
```

### 5. Build and Development Tools

#### Enhanced Makefile
Added new targets:
- `make pre-commit` - Run pre-commit hooks
- `make security-check` - Basic security checks
- Improved `make test` - Now includes shellcheck
- Improved `make check-deps` - Better output formatting

Example output:
```
$ make check-deps
Checking dependencies...
✓ python3 found
✓ pip found
⚠️  iperf3 not found
✓ jq found
✓ shellcheck found
✓ Dependency check complete
```

### 6. Logging Improvements

#### Structured Logging
- Replaced `print` statements with `logger` calls
- Added appropriate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)
- Consistent logging format across modules

Before:
```python
print(f"[{agent['host']}] Test finalizado.")
```

After:
```python
logger.info(f"[{agent['host']}] Test finalizado.")
```
