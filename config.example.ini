# WiFi Survey - Example Local Configuration
# This is an example of a local configuration file.
# Copy this to config.local.ini and customize for your environment.

[server]
# IP address of the iperf3 server
# This should be the IP of your PC/server running 'iperf3 -s'
# Examples:
#   - 192.168.1.10 (typical home network)
#   - 10.0.0.5 (some routers use 10.x.x.x)
ip = 192.168.1.10

# Flask web server host
# - Use 127.0.0.1 for localhost only (most secure, only accessible from device)
# - Use 0.0.0.0 to allow access from other devices on the network
flask_host = 0.0.0.0

# Flask web server port
flask_port = 5000

[iperf]
# Duration of iperf3 tests in seconds
# - Shorter tests (10-20s) are faster but less accurate
# - Longer tests (30-60s) are more accurate but take more time
# - Range: 1-300 seconds
# - Recommended: 20 seconds for quick surveys, 60 for detailed analysis
duration = 20

# Number of parallel streams for iperf3
# - More streams can saturate the connection better
# - Too many streams may cause overhead
# - Range: 1-16 streams
# - Recommended: 4 streams for most cases
parallel = 4

[survey]
# Default number of repetitions per measurement point
# - More repetitions improve statistical reliability
# - Fewer repetitions speed up the survey
# - Range: 1-100
# - Recommended: 3-5 repetitions
default_repeats = 3

# Enable manual confirmation mode by default
# - true: Wait for user confirmation at each point
# - false: Automatically proceed to next point
manual_mode = false

[paths]
# Directory for raw JSON results
# Relative to the application directory
raw_results = raw_results

# CSV output file
# Relative to the application directory
csv_file = wifi_survey_results.csv

[logging]
# Logging level
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
# - DEBUG: Very verbose, useful for troubleshooting
# - INFO: Normal operational information
# - WARNING: Only warnings and errors
# - ERROR: Only errors
level = INFO

# Log file path
# Leave empty to log to console only
# Example: wifi_survey.log

[advanced]
# Maximum number of measurement points per survey
# This prevents accidental creation of very large surveys

# Maximum number of repetitions per point
# This prevents accidental infinite loops

# Request timeout in seconds
# Maximum time to wait for a single request
